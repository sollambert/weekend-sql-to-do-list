## Description
A to do list application that allows you to create tasks with names, descriptions and subtasks that can be individually and persistently checked off. When the checkmark button is clicked the task is given a slightly transparent background to singify its completion and a timestamp is added. There is alerting for input validation and delete confirmation with sweet alerts.
